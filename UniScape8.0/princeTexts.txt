Oh, hey Alvaro... I was waiting for you... I guess you want the key to get out of my castle... but... first i need you to do me a favour... I'd like you to go to the dark room downstairs and bring me what is inside the box on the center of the room... i'll give you the key when you bring it :D

That's what i wanted! Thanks thanks thanks thanks!.

This is the only memory i have from them since i moved from home... Yes... they are my family... This bearded man here is my dad, he is really good with the bow and arrows... this lady here  is my mom, she prays a lot for me and eve tho i don't believe in it that let me know she worries for me and i like that... this girl here is my sister... we fight some times but i know she loves me... and i miss her now... and this little thing here is our dog, he's allways running around and maiking noise... now that he is not here the house feels empty... Thanks to you now i won't forget them. Princes always keep their word so take this...
